    <h3>About Post 2 Message</h3>

    <p>Members of the kite surfing clubs “Spilt” and “Komin” were preparing for a new season by cleaning the beach when
        they came across a pile of battered bottles. A young member of the club, Matea Medak-Rezic, noticed that one of
        the old bottles had a message inside.

        The message read, "Mary, you really are a great person. I hope we can keep in correspondence. I said I would
        write. Your friend always, Jonathon. Nova Scotia '85."

        The message and the bottle had travelled across the Atlantic Ocean, through the straights of Gibraltar, around
        the Mediterranean Sea, and into the Adriatic Sea before washing up on the Dalmatian coast. That's a journey of
        around 4,000 miles as the crow flies, but this bottle probably made a journey at least five times longer.</p>

    <p>Nearly a quarter-century after a German boy tossed a message in a bottle off a ship in the Baltic Sea, he's
        received an answer. A 13-year-old Russian, Daniil Korotkikh, was walking with his parents on a beach when he saw
        something glittering in the sand. “I saw that bottle and it looked interesting,” Korotkikh said. “It looked like
        a German beer bottle with a ceramic plug, and there was a message inside.” His father, who knows German,
        translated the letter, which was carefully wrapped in cellophane and sealed with a medical bandage. It said, “My
        name is Frank, and I'm five years old. My dad and I are traveling on a ship to Denmark. If you find this letter,
        please write back to me, and I will write back to you.” The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town
        of Coesfeld. </p>
